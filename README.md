## Design
- To address functional requirement that is architecturally significant, we have created six different [**Architecture Decision Records**](./specs/adrs/). 
- In the [**Starting Pitch**](./docs/misc/starting-pitch.pdf), we first describe the problem that we are trying to solve, then come up with user personas, and develop a solution. We have also included our initial designs like Fat Marker Sketch and wireframe, acknowledged the rabbet holes, and brought up some no-go's.
- In the [**Miro (Password: NinePlusTen)**](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lJdxiAU=/), we have the **high and low-fidelity designs**, some feature ideas, and user personas.
