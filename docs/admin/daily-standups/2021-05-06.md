# Daily standup for Thursday, May 6, 2021

Thomas Garry - Found some resources like https://github.com/bastianallgeier/bulletjournal/blob/master/index.html https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-quick-but-complete-guide-to-indexeddb-25f030425501/ and created an indexeddb example --> found out this project may be harder than expected --> tried different ways of adding bullet points with editable divs (so that you can tab between them) (i dont really like that solution tho) found that we could use jquery to add bullet points to the textarea while typing (brings in issue of picking the bullet point and it won't look like the design).... I will explain this at tomorrow's meeting

Alexander Berryhill-Williams - Experimented with creating and deleting bullet points and using contenteditable

Jerry Guo - nothing

Lucas Bajoua - nothing

Judy Liu - Nothing
