# Daily standup for Saturday, May 15, 2021

Thomas Garry - made a PR and found the issues with eslint/prettier/cicd (don't know the fix though)

Alexander Berryhill-Williams - Added basic note functionality to the Daily Log page, revised notes to use custom HTML element to make modifications easier

Judy Liu - Sticky notes page

Lucas Bajoua - put a mini calendar in the weekly page (but we’ll probably scratch it for tyler’s)
