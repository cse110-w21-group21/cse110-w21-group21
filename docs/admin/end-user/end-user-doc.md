On the calendar view, you can find a monthly calendar that will display your events. You can navigate through different months using the arrow buttons on the top right, and the "today" button will bring you back to the current month.

### Create Event

Clicking the "Create Event" button will pull up a form allowing you to create a new event. You can set the title, color, and details for any event. Multi day events will allow you to set a start date and end date. Single day events will allow only a start date, but can also include a start time and end time. These can be toggled using the checkbox. Once all the information has been entered, clicking "Submit" will create the event.

### Edit Event

### Mini Calendar

On the top half of the weekly and daily log pages, you will find a mini calendar displaying your events for the week or the day.
