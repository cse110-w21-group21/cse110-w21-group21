# Allow User-Recorded Audio

* Status: [denied until more progress made]
* Deciders: [team decision]
* Date: [2021-05-10]

## Context and Problem Statement

Should we allow users to record audio to act as fast notes?

## Considered Options

* Find a way to store user audio recordings
* Don't allow users to record audio

## Decision Outcome

Chose to implement application as only a webpage unless schedule opens up near the end of the development cycle.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Implementing audio recorder

* Good, allows flexibility in user interaction
* Good, extra feature compared to traditional BuJo
* Bad, requires more-than-typical storage
* Bad, could lead to non-ideal storage implementation strictly to support this feature

### Don't implement audio recorder

* Good, saves devtime
* Good, less data to store
* Bad, boring, whack, lame
