# Web or Desktop Implementation

* Status: [denied until more progress made]
* Deciders: [team decision]
* Date: [2021-05-10]

## Context and Problem Statement

Should we use ElectronJS to allow users to download our application to their desktop and work outside of a browser?

## Considered Options

* Implement ElectronJS 
* Implement the application only as a webpage

## Decision Outcome

Chose to implement application as only a webpage unless schedule opens up near the end of the development cycle.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Implementing ElectronJS

* Good, has multiple features bundled in we can add to application
* Good, acts as a wrapper letting our webpage be used as a desktop application
* Bad, requires dev time
* Bad, could lead to speedbumps in implementation

### Implement as a webpage

* Good, saves devtime
* Bad, limits application to web-only
