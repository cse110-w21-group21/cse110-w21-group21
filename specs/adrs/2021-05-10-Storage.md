* Status: [accepted]
* Deciders: [backend decision]
* Date: [2021-05-10]

## Context and Problem Statement

How should we store ___persistent___ user data so that users don't have to keep inputting their preferences/tasks across sessions?

## Considered Options

* Arrays (in code)
* LocalStorage
* IndexedDB

## Decision Outcome



## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Arrays

* Good, quick & easy to add, change, access data
* Good, we can store multiple datatypes
* Bad, doesn't persist across sessions

### LocalStorage

* Good, preserves data across user sessions (in browser)
* Bad, not as much storage as IndexedDB
* Bad, we have to convert all data to Strings

### IndexedDB

* Good, size is bigger for larger amounts of data
* Good, no type specification
* Bad, slightly more complexity
