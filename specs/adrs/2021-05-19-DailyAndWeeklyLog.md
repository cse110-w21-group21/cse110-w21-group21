## Context and Problem Statement

How should bulleted notes/todos/etc work on the Daily Log and Weekly Log pages?

## Considered Options

- Type notes on the Daily Log page, mark certain notes as important, important notes also appear on weekly log
- Store weekly notes and daily notes separately from each other, use Weekly Log to show only notes for the week and Daily Log to show only notes for the day

## Decision Outcome

Important notes display on weekly log

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Mark notes as important to display on Weekly Log

- Automates the sharing of notes between weekly and daily logs, which is a benefit of a digital BJ vs a physical one
- Users may want to have notes appear on both, and the other option requires them to enter them twice
- 

### Distinct Daily and Weekly Notes

- Potentially easier to implement without changing how the notes are stored
- Closer to how physical bullet journals are typically set up
- Allows users to create goals for the week
